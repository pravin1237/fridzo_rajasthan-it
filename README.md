# Hackers activity analysis using SDN and Machine learning Techniques for Cybercrime department

Problem Statement

- Network threat analysis in the Network system to detect and mitigate malicious logs.
- Cyber crime department use this technique to trap the Hackers and their activities

SDN

- SDN primarily segregates the control and data planes.
The main goal of this Project is to develop a detection to identify Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks in the SDN environment.
- For SDN , we have used the RYU controller and mininet for Virtual Network Environment.
- In this project, we use training Dataset and the parameters of normal traffic, such as payload size, packet per flow, to identify the legitimate attack for training.
- Then we use the parameters for attack using different tuples for training.
- After the analysis we start the traffic on single host by multiple host in the networ
